  "summary": "REQ-10 and REQ-11 appear implemented: the Islamic letter templates were translated to Bahasa Indonesia with Quran references preserved, and the Letter section’s specified defaults/placeholders (fallback sender, fallback letter text, textarea placeholder, sign-off line) were updated to Indonesian. However, additional LetterSection UI strings beyond the requested defaults/placeholders were also translated, which may exceed the stated constraint/non-goals.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest constraints/non-goals say to only change language of the letter templates and letter-related defaults/placeholders; REQ-11 only calls out specific defaults/placeholders, not the rest of the LetterSection UI labels.",
